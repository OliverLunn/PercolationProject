# PercolationProject
Repository containing simulations for Percolation Project. A 4th Year project for the school of Phyiscs and Astronomy at the University of Nottingham.

This repository uses a Monte-Carlo method to simulate the percolation phase transition at and about the crtical probabilty.
We first simulate a percolation model in 2D and then go on to explore the characteristics of the system about the critical point.
